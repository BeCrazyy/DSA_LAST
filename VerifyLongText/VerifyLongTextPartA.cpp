/*
Problem Description:
================

Given an order string and a text, verify whether the text follows the order rule defined by the order string.

The order rule states that for an order string like "abcd":
- 'a' cannot appear at any position after 'b', 'c', or 'd' in the text
- 'b' cannot appear at any position after 'c' or 'd' in the text  
- 'c' cannot appear at any position after 'd' in the text

Example:
- Order string: "abcd"
                 0123   
- Text: "axubbxcxbxd"
         0--11-2-
- Result: Invalid (violates rule because 'b' appears after 'c' in substring "cxb")

The algorithm works by:
1. Mapping each character in the order string to its position
2. Scanning the text left to right
3. Tracking the maximum order position seen so far
4. For each character from the order string found in text:
   - If its order position < maximum seen so far â†’ violation found
   - Otherwise, update the maximum order position seen

Time Complexity: O(n + m) where n = text length, m = order string length
Space Complexity: O(m) for storing character-to-order mapping
